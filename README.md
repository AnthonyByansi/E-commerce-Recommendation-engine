Collaborative E-commerce Recommendation Engine
This project aims to build a recommendation engine for an e-commerce website using collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is a method of recommendation where past behaviors and preferences of users are used to predict what a user would like in the future.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.6 or later
A collection of user data containing past interactions with the e-commerce website (e.g., viewed products, purchased products, ratings and reviews)
## Setup
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt.`
Download the user data and place it in the `data` directory.
## Usage
To run the recommendation engine:

Preprocess the user data by running `python preprocess.py`.
Train the collaborative filtering model by running `python train.py`.
Make recommendations for a given user by running `python recommend.py <user_id>.`
## Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the recommendation engine, you can split the user data into a training set and a test set and compare the recommendations made on the test set with the actual ratings or interactions of the users.
